# Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Thank you for showing an interest in YouWidget. I take your privacy very seriously. I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. Therefore, YouWidget is built to keep your data completely private.

## Authentication
YouWidget utilises Google Sign-on for authentication. Your Google account is linked to your YouTube account. Your Google password **never** gets shared with YouWidget. When you sign into your Google account via YouWidget, it is done securely via Google’s website and YouWidget is given **read-only** permission to your account via a token. This token is used to authenticate with the YouTube Data API and hence allows YouWidget to access YouTube data. You can revoke YouWidgets’s access to your account from Google’s website at any time. The app **does not** have write access to your Google/YouTube account. You can read more about Google’s Privacy policies [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Storage
YouWidget uses the YouTube Data API to fetch video, channel and profile information to display in the app. This data **does not** leave your device. We do not and will never share, upload, or have access to this information. All your data stays strictly on **your** device.

## Personally-Identifying Information

YouWidget does not transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device.

## Changes to Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is subject to change periodically. By using YouWidget you accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
