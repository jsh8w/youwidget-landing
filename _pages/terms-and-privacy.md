# Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Thank you for showing an interest in YouWidget. I take your privacy very seriously. I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. Therefore, YouWidget is built to keep your data completely private.

## Your Privacy
I (James Shaw) built YouWidget (also termed "the Service", "our Service", or "this Service") as a free app. YouWidget is currently provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This part of the YouWidget support website is used to inform YouWidget users regarding it's policies on the manner in which YouWidget accesses, uses, stores, or shares user data ("Personal Information").

If you choose to use YouWidget, then you agree to the request and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that the service requests is used for providing and improving YouWidget. The service will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, and in order to provide our Service, the app may require you to provide us, either directly or indirectly, with certain personally identifiable information. The information that the service requests will be used as described in this privacy policy.

The app uses third party services that may collect information used to identify you. Links to privacy policies of third party service providers used by YouWidget:

- [Google Sign-in](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [YouTube Data API Services](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service)

The following data is requested from your Google/YouTube account. This data is only used to be displayed in the app's widgets.
- Email Address
- First and Last Name
- YouTube Channel Name
- YouTube Channel Avatar
- YouTube Channel Statistics (Subscriber, View, Video and Comment Count)
- YouTube Channel Videos
- YouTube Channel Subscriptions

The above data is requested and stored **locally** on your device. It **does not and will not** be shared outside of YouWidget.

## Authentication
YouWidget utilises Google Sign-in for authentication. Your Google account is linked to your YouTube account. Your Google password **never** gets shared with YouWidget. When you sign into your Google account via YouWidget, it is done securely via Google’s website and YouWidget is given **read-only** permission to your account via an authorization token.

This token is used to authenticate with the YouTube Data API and hence allows YouWidget to access YouTube data as described above. The token is stored securely in your device's keychain. The app **does not** have write access to your Google/YouTube account. You can revoke YouWidgets’s access to your YouTube account at any time from [Google's Security Settings Page](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions).

## YouTube Data API Services
As mentioned above, YouWidget uses YouTube Data API Services to request YouTube data. Therefore, by using YouWidget, you are agreeing to be bound by the [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms), [Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy), and [API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service) when engaging YouTube content and services through the app.

## Security
I value your trust in providing the service with your Personal Information, thus the service uses commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites
YouWidget may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Premium Purchases
If you sign-up for YouWidget Premium, either via Subscription or In-App Purchase, your billing information, address, and name are all maintained by the Apple App Store and are not visible to me. I will simply get information about whether or not you have purchased a subscription/in-app purchase, the term you signed up for and when it is due to expire. This is all made available to me in an anonymous fashion. This anonymous data is also shared with my purchase provider [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/dpa).

## Changes to Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new or updated Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

## Contact Me
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this privacy policy or YouWidget.
